## Introduction

This document traces the relationship between requirements (R), their implementations (I), and validation (V) processes for the development process,aims to ensure all functional requirements are implemented and traceable to their respective implementations.

## Software Traceability

### Requirement to Implementation to Validation Mapping

| Requirement | Is implemented by | Is validated by |
| ----------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| R1.1        |                   |                 |
| R1.2        |                   |                 |
| R1.2        |                   |                 |
| R1.2        |                   |                 |
| R1.2        |                   |                 |
| R1.2        |                   |                 |
| R1.2        |                   |                 |



## Coverage Analysis

- Requirements coverage: [Percentage of requirements implemented and tested]
- Test coverage: [Percentage of code covered by tests]
- Gap analysis: [Any requirements without sufficient implementation or validation]
