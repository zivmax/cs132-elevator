1. Setup the Environment 
python 3.10+
pip install pyzmq

2. Code Structure
/YourCodeExample/NetClient.py - This file is responsible for communicating with the server in the test cases.
/YourCodeExample/main.py - This file contains a sample student code, which you can modify to be the main file of your own designed system.
/TestCase/main.py - This file is responsible for sending test cases to your system and will interact based on the data sent by your system, including a very simple test case.
/TestCase/Server.py - This file is responsible for communicating with the client in the student code.

3.How to Run the Code
First, run /TestCase/main.py in Terminal to setup the judger.
Then, run /YourCodeExample/main.py in ANOTHER Terminal.
Finally, input 'y' to run the naive testcase.


4.available operation/event

    //available user operation

    "open_door": ["#1", "#2"], open_door#1 means open the doors of elevator #1.
    "close_door": ["#1", "#2"], close_door#1 means close the doors of elevator #1.
    "call_up": ["-1", "1", "2"], //For example, call_up@1 means a user on the first floor presses the button to call the elevator to go upwards.
    "call_down": ["3", "2", "1"], //For instance, call_down@3 signifies a user on the third floor pressing the button to call the elevator to go downwards.
    "select_floor": ["-1#1", "-1#2", "1#1", "1#2", "2#1", "2#2", "3#1", "3#2"], //For example, select_floor@2#1 means a user in elevator #1 selects to go to the second floor.
    "reset": When your elevator system receives a reset signal, it should reset the elevator's state machine to its initial state

    //available system event

    "door_opened": ["#1", "#2"], door_opened#1 means the doors of elevator #1 have opened.
    "door_closed": ["#1", "#2"], door_closed#1 means the doors of elevator #1 have closed.
    "floor_arrived":["up","down",""],["-1","1","2","3"],["#1", "#2"] //"up_floor_1_arrived#1"ï¼Œ indicating that elevator #1 has arrived at the first floor while moving upwards. "floor_1_arrived#1",indicating that elevator #1 has stopped at the first floor.

5.Elevator system initial assumption
Assume that both elevators(#1, #2) initially stop on the first floor and the doors are closed.
