## Documentation Style Guide

### Overall Structure and Organization

**Hierarchical Section Numbering**
- Use clear numerical hierarchy (1, 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.)
- Each major section should have a descriptive title
- Subsections should be logically grouped and progressively detailed

**Document Flow Pattern**
- Start with broad concepts, then narrow to specific implementation details
- Follow a logical progression: Overview → Analysis → Implementation → Results
- Each section should build upon previous sections

### Section Format Standards

**Major Section Headers (Level 1)**
- Use `## [Number]. [Title]` format
- Provide brief introductory paragraph explaining section purpose
- Include scope and methodology overview

**Subsection Headers (Level 2-4)**
- Use consistent numbering: `### [Number].[Number] [Title]`
- Include clear descriptive titles that indicate content type
- Subsections should have focused, single-purpose content

### Content Organization Patterns

**Analysis Sections**
- Start with identification and categorization
- Provide systematic enumeration of items (branches, test cases, risks)
- Use structured templates for consistency
- Include quantitative metrics and targets

**Implementation Sections**
- Provide clear file structure layouts
- Include execution commands with proper syntax
- Specify prerequisites and dependencies
- Detail success criteria and acceptance metrics

**Test Documentation Format**
- Use consistent test case identifiers (TC1, TC2, IT1, ST1, etc.)
- Structure test cases with: Description → Steps → Expected Results → Acceptance Criteria
- Group related test cases by functionality or component
- Include traceability matrices linking tests to requirements

### Technical Content Standards

**Code Examples and File Structures**
- Use proper syntax highlighting with language specification
- Provide complete file paths and directory structures
- Include configuration examples where relevant
- Show both individual commands and batch execution options

**Metrics and Coverage Reporting**
- Present quantitative targets prominently
- Use tables for coverage matrices and traceability
- Include both target and achieved percentages
- Provide historical baseline data where applicable

**Risk and Analysis Documentation**
- Use systematic risk identification format (R1, R2, etc.)
- Include frequency and severity assessments
- Provide clear mitigation strategies with implementation evidence
- Link risks to specific test cases or verification methods

### Visual and Formatting Standards

**Emphasis and Highlighting**
- Use **bold text** for key terms, test case identifiers, and critical information
- Use *italics* for emphasis on important concepts or conditions
- Use `code formatting` for technical terms, file names, and commands
- Use structured lists for step-by-step procedures

**Table Usage**
- Create tables for traceability matrices, coverage metrics, and comparison data
- Include clear column headers and consistent formatting
- Use tables to summarize complex relationships between components

**Information Architecture**
- Use bullet points for lists of related items
- Use numbered lists for sequential procedures
- Include code blocks for examples and configuration
- Provide cross-references between related sections

### Quality and Maintenance Standards

**Completeness Requirements**
- Each component or feature should have corresponding test coverage
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Document maintenance procedures and update requirements
- Provide clear success criteria for each verification method

**Traceability and Verification**
- Link implementation details to requirements
- Include verification evidence (test results, model checking output)
- Provide timestamps and version information for verification results
- Maintain consistency between different verification methods

**Professional Documentation Standards**
- Use formal, technical language appropriate for engineering documentation
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout the document
- Include implementation commands that can be executed directly
- Provide sufficient detail for reproduction and maintenance

This style guide captures the systematic, engineering-focused approach used in the validation document, emphasizing thorough coverage, clear traceability, and practical implementation guidance.
