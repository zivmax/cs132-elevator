## 2. Model Checking

Model checking is employed for the formal verification of critical system properties using state-space exploration. Our elevator system is modeled using UPPAAL, a tool for modeling, simulation, and verification of real-time systems. Due to the inherent complexity of the real-world elevator system, our UPPAAL model incorporates necessary abstractions and simplifications to make formal verification feasible.

The system model in UPPAAL consists of several interacting timed automata templates: `Elevator`, `Dispatcher`, `Passenger`, and an `Initializer`. These templates define the behavior of individual components and their interactions through channels and shared variables.

**Key Abstractions and Simplifications:**
*   **Discrete Representation:** Continuous aspects like elevator speed and precise door movement are modeled using discrete time durations (e.g., `TIME_DOOR_OPERATE`, `TIME_FLOOR_TRAVEL`).
*   **Bounded Parameters:** The number of elevators (`NUM_ELEVATORS = 2`), passengers (`NUM_PASSENGERS = 3`), floors (`MIN_FLOOR = 0`, `MAX_FLOOR = 3`), and concurrent calls (`MAX_CALLS = 4`) are fixed constants. This bounds the state space but means the model verifies a specific configuration.
*   **Simplified Queues:** Both the system-wide call queue (`system_calls`) and individual elevator task queues (`target_q`) have fixed maximum sizes.
*   **Atomic Operations:** Some complex decision-making logic in the real implementation (e.g., sophisticated dispatching algorithms) might be simplified to more deterministic choices or abstract transitions in the model.
*   **Floor 0 Skipping:** The model includes specific logic for buildings with a floor 0 that might be skipped under certain conditions (`skip-zero` logic in `advance_current_floor_one_step` and `is_next_floor_target`), which is a specific feature modeled.

These simplifications are justified as they allow for tractable analysis of core system properties like deadlock freedom and request satisfaction, while still capturing the essential concurrent and real-time behaviors.

**Global Declarations:**
The model defines global constants for system parameters, states (e.g., `STATE_IDLE`, `DOOR_CLOSED`), and timing values. Key data structures include:
*   `call_info_t`: A struct to store information about a passenger's call (caller, floor, direction, state).
*   `system_calls`: A global array of `call_info_t` representing the central call management system.
*   Communication channels: `make_call`, `elv_doors_opened`, `elv_select_floor`, `assign_task`, `notify_call_completed` for synchronization between templates.

**Templates:**
1.  **`Elevator` Template:**
    *   **Parameters:** `const elevator_id_t eid`
    *   **Purpose:** Models the behavior of an individual elevator car.
    *   **Key States:**
        *   `InitElevator`: Initializes local elevator state.
        *   `Idle`: Waiting for tasks, processing its queue, or ready to receive tasks.
        *   `Moving`: Traveling between floors. Invariant: `t_travel <= TIME_FLOOR_TRAVEL && door_state == DOOR_CLOSED`.
        *   `D_Opening`: Door is in the process of opening. Invariant: `clk_d <= TIME_DOOR_OPERATE`.
        *   `D_Open`: Door is fully open. Invariant: `clk_d <= TIME_DOOR_OPEN_TIMEOUT`.
        *   `D_Closing`: Door is in the process of closing. Invariant: `clk_d <= TIME_DOOR_OPERATE`.
        *   `Call_Completing`: A committed state to handle call completion notification.
    *   **Key Variables:**
        *   `clk_d`: Clock for door operations.
        *   `t_travel`: Clock for floor travel time.
        *   `current_floor`: The elevator's current floor.
        *   `door_state`: Current state of the door (e.g., `DOOR_CLOSED`, `DOOR_OPENED`).
        *   `q_len`: Number of tasks in the elevator's internal queue.
        *   `target_q[]`: Array storing target floors.
        *   `target_call_idx_q[]`: Array storing call indices corresponding to target floors.
        *   `move_dir`: Current or intended direction of movement.
        *   `needs_to_move`: Boolean flag indicating if the elevator should move.
    *   **Core Functions (executed on transitions):** `init_local_elevator_state`, `add_to_queue`, `process_next_target`, `handle_door_opening/opened/closing/closed`, `advance_current_floor_one_step`.

2.  **`Dispatcher` Template:**
    *   **Purpose:** Manages incoming passenger calls and assigns them to available elevators.
    *   **Key States:**
        *   `Idle`: Waiting for new calls or notifications of completed calls.
        *   `Assigning`: Actively trying to assign a pending call to an elevator.
    *   **Key Variables:**
        *   `selected_call_idx`: Index of the call currently being processed for assignment.
        *   `new_call_idx_holder`: Temporarily stores the index of a newly added call.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Receives `make_call` requests from `Passenger` templates.
        *   Uses `add_new_call()` to add calls to the `system_calls` array.
        *   Selects pending calls (`system_calls[i].struct_state == CALL_STATE_PENDING`).
        *   Assigns tasks to `Elevator` templates via the `assign_task` channel.
        *   Updates call state to `CALL_STATE_ASSIGNED`.
        *   Receives `notify_call_completed` from `Elevator` templates and sets call state to `CALL_STATE_IDLE`.

3.  **`Initializer` Template:**
    *   **Purpose:** Ensures the system starts in a well-defined state.
    *   **Key States:** `Init`, `Done`.
    *   **Functionality:** Executes `init_system_calls()` to initialize the global `system_calls` array and sets a global `initialized` flag to `true`, allowing other processes (like Passengers) to start their operations.

### 2.2 Environment Model

The environment, primarily user interactions, is modeled by the `Passenger` template.

**`Passenger` Template:**
*   **Parameters:** `const passenger_id_t pid`, `const floor_t p_start_floor`, `const floor_t p_dest_floor`.
*   **Purpose:** Simulates a passenger's journey from their starting floor to their destination.
*   **Key States:**
    *   `AtStart`: Initial state. If start and destination are the same, transitions to `Arrived`.
    *   `Waiting`: Passenger has made a call and is waiting for an elevator.
    *   `Boarding` (committed): Passenger is entering the elevator after doors open.
    *   `InElevator`: Passenger is inside the elevator and has selected their destination.
    *   `Alighting` (committed): Passenger is exiting the elevator at the destination.
    *   `Arrived`: Passenger has reached their destination floor.
*   **Functionality:**
    1.  If not already at the destination, makes a call using the `make_call` channel, specifying their ID, current floor, and desired direction. This occurs only after the `Initializer` sets `initialized` to true.
    2.  Waits for an elevator's doors to open at their current floor (synchronizes on `elv_doors_opened`).
    3.  Boards the elevator and selects their destination floor (synchronizes on `elv_select_floor`).
    4.  Waits inside the elevator until it reaches their destination floor and doors open (synchronizes on `elv_doors_opened`).
    5.  Exits the elevator and transitions to the `Arrived` state, setting `passenger_arrived[pid] = true`.
*   This template covers essential user operations: calling an elevator from a floor and selecting a destination floor from within the elevator. The specific scenarios are determined by the instantiation of `Passenger` templates in the system definition (e.g., `P0 = Passenger(0, 1, 3);`).

### 2.3 Verification Queries

The following queries were used to verify properties of the UPPAAL model. The results are based on the model execution with `NUM_ELEVATORS = 2`, `NUM_PASSENGERS = 3`, and specific passenger journeys (`P0(0,1,3)`, `P1(1,2,0)`, `P2(2,2,3)`).

1.  **Query:** `E<> passenger_arrived[0] && passenger_arrived[1] && passenger_arrived[2]`
    *   **Purpose:** To check if there exists at least one execution trace (is it possible?) where all three defined passengers (Passenger 0, Passenger 1, and Passenger 2) eventually reach their respective destination floors.
    *   **Result:** `success` (Timestamp: 2025-06-07 19:12:42 +0800)
    *   **Interpretation:** The model demonstrates that the system can service these three passengers, and they can all arrive at their destinations. This is a basic liveness property indicating the system can fulfill its primary purpose for this scenario.

2.  **Query:** `A[] not deadlock`
    *   **Purpose:** To check if the system is free from deadlocks in all possible execution paths (globally, always). A deadlock would mean the system reaches a state where no further actions can be taken.
    *   **Result:** `success` (Timestamp: 2025-06-07 19:12:05 +0800)
    *   **Interpretation:** The model is deadlock-free. This is a crucial safety property, ensuring the system will always remain operational and responsive.

3.  **Query:** `A[] (not E0.Moving or E0.door_state == DOOR_CLOSED) and (not E1.Moving or E1.door_state == DOOR_CLOSED)`
    *   **Purpose:** To verify a critical safety property: for all elevators (E0 and E1), it must always be true that if an elevator is in its `Moving` state, its doors must be in the `DOOR_CLOSED` state.
    *   **Result:** `success` (Timestamp: 2025-06-07 19:12:48 +0800)
    *   **Interpretation:** The model satisfies this safety requirement. Elevators do not move with their doors open, which aligns with expected safety standards.

These verification results provide confidence in the correctness of the modeled system aspects concerning passenger arrival, deadlock freedom, and door safety during movement.

## 3. Risk Management

### 3.1 Risk Analysis

This section identifies potential risks in the elevator system, analyzing their frequency and severity to ensure safe and reliable operation.

#### 3.1.1 Passenger Service Risks

**Risk R1: Passenger Call Never Serviced (Starvation)**
- **Description**: A passenger's elevator call is never assigned to an elevator, causing them to wait indefinitely at a floor.
- **When it happens**: When all elevators are continuously busy with other tasks, and the dispatcher's `_can_elevator_serve_call()` method only assigns calls to completely idle elevators (no tasks, doors closed, not moving).
- **Frequency**: Low - Occurs primarily in high-traffic scenarios or when elevators are stuck in cyclic movement patterns.
- **Severity**: High - Critical user experience failure, potential safety concern if passenger is stranded.

**Risk R2: Elevator Never Arrives at Called Floor**
- **Description**: An elevator is assigned to a floor call but never actually reaches the destination due to algorithm or state management issues.
- **When it happens**: 
  - Task queue optimization errors in `_optimize_task_queue()` removing target floors
  - Direction determination logic in `_determine_direction()` causing incorrect movement
  - State inconsistencies where elevator believes it has served a floor when it hasn't
- **Frequency**: Very Low - Would indicate serious algorithmic bugs.
- **Severity**: Critical - Complete service failure, potential safety hazard.

**Risk R3: Doors Never Open at Destination Floor**
- **Description**: Elevator arrives at the correct floor but doors remain closed, preventing passenger boarding/alighting.
- **When it happens**:
  - Door state machine errors in `update()` method
  - Task completion logic failures in `_handle_arrival_at_target_floor()`
  - Race conditions between floor arrival and door operations
- **Frequency**: Low - Robust door state management reduces likelihood.
- **Severity**: High - Passenger cannot complete journey, potential entrapment.

#### 3.1.2 System Reliability Risks

**Risk R4: Deadlock Between Elevators**
- **Description**: System reaches a state where no elevator can make progress, halting all operations.
- **When it happens**:
  - Circular wait conditions in dispatcher task assignment
  - Resource conflicts between elevators competing for the same calls
  - State inconsistencies causing infinite waiting loops
- **Frequency**: Very Low - UPPAAL model verification shows deadlock-free property.
- **Severity**: Critical - Complete system failure requiring manual intervention.

**Risk R5: Elevator Moving with Doors Open**
- **Description**: Safety violation where elevator begins movement while doors are not fully closed.
- **When it happens**:
  - Race condition between door closing completion and movement initiation
  - Door state detection failures in `request_movement_if_needed()`
  - Incorrect door state transitions in the `update()` loop
- **Frequency**: Very Low - Multiple safety checks prevent this condition.
- **Severity**: Critical - Severe safety hazard, potential injury to passengers.

#### 3.1.3 Performance and Efficiency Risks

**Risk R6: Suboptimal Elevator Dispatching**
- **Description**: Elevators are consistently assigned inefficiently, leading to poor service times and passenger dissatisfaction.
- **When it happens**:
  - Estimation algorithm errors in `calculate_estimated_time()`
  - Greedy dispatching without considering global optimization
  - Insufficient consideration of elevator load balancing
- **Frequency**: Medium - Optimization algorithms are heuristic-based.
- **Severity**: Medium - Performance degradation but not safety-critical.

**Risk R7: Task Queue Overflow**
- **Description**: Elevator task queues become overloaded, potentially causing memory issues or dropped requests.
- **When it happens**:
  - High volume of concurrent requests exceeding system capacity
  - Memory leaks in task queue management
  - Failure to remove completed tasks from queues
- **Frequency**: Low - System limits passenger capacity in model (NUM_PASSENGERS = 3).
- **Severity**: Medium - Service degradation, potential system instability.

#### 3.1.4 Communication and Interface Risks

**Risk R8: Message Loss Between Components**
- **Description**: Critical messages (door_opened, floor_arrived, etc.) are lost between elevator, dispatcher, and API components.
- **When it happens**:
  - Network communication failures in ZMQ interface
  - Threading synchronization issues
  - API message queue overflow
- **Frequency**: Low - Synchronous communication within backend reduces risk.
- **Severity**: High - Can cause state inconsistencies and service failures.

**Risk R9: Invalid User Input Handling**
- **Description**: System receives malformed or invalid commands that could cause crashes or unexpected behavior.
- **When it happens**:
  - Invalid floor numbers outside system bounds (-1, 1, 2, 3)
  - Invalid elevator IDs or directions
  - Malformed ZMQ commands from test clients
- **Frequency**: Medium - Depends on external input validation.
- **Severity**: Medium - Potential system instability, but input validation exists.
