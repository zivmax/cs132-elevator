## Basic Operations

### Calling an Elevator

**Purpose**: Summon an elevator to your current floor

**Steps:**

1. Identify your current floor on the building visualization
2. Determine your intended direction (up or down)
3. Click the appropriate call button:
   - **‚ñ≤** for going up to higher floors
   - **‚ñº** for going down to lower floors
4. Wait for the elevator to arrive (button will remain lit)
5. The button will reset when an elevator reaches your floor

**Example Scenario:**

- You're on Floor 2 and want to go to Floor 3
- Click the "‚ñ≤" button next to Floor 2
- Watch as the nearest available elevator moves to Floor 2
- The elevator doors will open automatically upon arrival

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Always select the correct direction button. Elevators optimize their routes based on the direction of your call.

### Selecting Your Destination

**Purpose**: Choose which floor you want to visit

**Steps:**

1. Ensure you're "inside" an elevator (doors are open at your floor)
2. Look at the control panel for the appropriate elevator
3. Click the button corresponding to your destination floor
4. The button will light up to confirm your selection
5. The elevator will automatically close doors and move to your destination

**Multiple Destinations:**

- You can select multiple floors for one trip
- The elevator will visit floors in optimal order
- Each destination button will light up when selected

**Floor Button Reference:**

- **"3"**: Top floor
- **"2"**: Second floor
- **"1"**: Ground floor (main entrance)
- **"-1"**: Basement level

### Manual Door Control

**Purpose**: Override automatic door operations

**When to Use:**

- Hold doors open for additional passengers
- Close doors immediately without waiting
- Emergency situations requiring door control

**Open Doors Manually:**

1. Click the "‚óÄ ‚ñ∂" button in the elevator control panel
2. Doors will open immediately
3. Doors will remain open until manually closed or timeout occurs

**Close Doors Manually:**

1. Click the "‚ñ∂ ‚óÄ" button in the elevator control panel
2. Doors will close immediately
3. If elevator has destinations, movement will begin automatically

üî¥ **Safety Note**: Manual door controls only work when the elevator is stopped at a floor. Moving elevators cannot have doors opened.
